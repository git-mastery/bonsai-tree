Proper bonsai care involves balancing water, light, and nutrients to maintain a healthy tree. Bonsais require well-draining soil and regular watering, but overwatering can lead to root rot. They need adequate sunlight, with indoor varieties thriving near bright windows and outdoor species requiring seasonal adjustments. Pruning and wiring help shape the tree, while repotting every few years ensures root health. Protecting bonsais from pests, extreme temperatures, and diseases is essential for their longevity, making their care both an art and a discipline.
