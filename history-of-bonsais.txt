Bonsai originated in China over a thousand years ago as "penjing," the art of miniature landscape cultivation. The practice later spread to Japan, where it evolved into the refined bonsai we know today, emphasizing simplicity, balance, and harmony with nature. Traditionally associated with Zen Buddhism, bonsai became a symbol of patience and artistic expression. Over time, it gained global popularity, with enthusiasts worldwide cultivating these miniature trees as a blend of horticulture and art.
